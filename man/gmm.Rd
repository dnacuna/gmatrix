\title{
Multiply two matrices with the output matrix allready allocated.
}
\description{
In effect this function sets C <- A \%*\% B. This makes it possible to avoid repeated allocation and deallocation steps which are very computationaly costly.
}
\usage{
gmm(A, B, C, trA=FALSE, trB=FALSE,  accum=FALSE) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{A, B}{
	Matrices to multiply together.
}
  \item{C}{
	Matrices where output will be saved.
}
  \item{trA, trB}{
  Should A or B be transposed.
}
  \item{accum}{
  if accum is set to TRUE, the multiplied matrix will be added to C (i.e. C<-C+A \%*\% B).
}


}
\details{
This function takes advantage of the fact that gmatrix objects are stored as pointers making it posible modify the input to a function. Thus the area of memory on the GPU pointed to by the C object is modified to contain A \%*\% B. 
}
\value{
Returns C invisibly.
