First the HMC code is a heavily modified version of the code created by Dr. Radford Neal.

Second, configure.ac file and other components of the build system borrowed heavily from

Third the binomial distribution simulation is modified from the GSL library which is liscensed

Neither Dr. Neal nor Dr. Smith have reviewed the changes to the code made by the gmatrix 
package author (Dr. Nathan Morris).
